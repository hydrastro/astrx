-- Teardown for the Bot-trap module (tools/module.php purge bottrap).
-- Destructive: removes the module's pages and drops its table. Re-enabling
-- afterwards requires reinstalling the schema (tools/install.php).

DELETE FROM `page` WHERE `module` = 'bottrap';

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `bot_trap_log`;

-- A nav entry whose page went away is dangling: delete its id-allocator row,
-- which cascades to the entry (navbar_entry.id references navbar_entry_ids).
-- Deleting only the entry, as this used to, left the allocator row behind for
-- good. Allocator rows with no entry at all are swept too (a normal install
-- has none; older purges left them).
